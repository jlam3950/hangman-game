Given two array of numbers return an array which holds the index of numbers from the second array if that number is a square of a number from array first array
Example:
a = [2,5,12,4,6,2]
b = [36,25,3,4]
expected result array = [3,1,-1,-1,0,3]
Explanation
a[0] = 2 => Square of 2 = 4 => 4 is index position 3 in second array
a[1] = 5 => Square of 5 = 25=> 25 is in index 1 in second array
a[2] = 12=> Square of 12 = 144 => 144 is not available in second array so -1
